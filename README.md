## my script for the umpteenth time  

yes, i know... this script might not be the best thing you've seen. however, i am making an effort to improve it and provide updates when possible.  

i originally created this script for personal use, but since i see potential in improving it further, i decided to make it public. feel free to modify, customize, or enhance it as you see fit. if you find any bugs or have ideas for improvements, i would appreciate it if you opened an [issue](https://github.com/kiuur/tempest/issues) or submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/kiuur/tempest/pulls).

## some little information  

this script actually supports buttons, but **i do not recommend using buttons on whatsapp just yet** to avoid potential issues.  

i am using **Baileys** from [`@kangfarrel`](https://github.com/kangfarrel/felzar-Baileys), a great library for WhatsApp bot development. Baileys is actively maintained and provides a solid foundation for building bots, so if you're interested in WhatsApp bot development, i highly recommend checking it out.  

### features  
- supports automatic responses  
- easy to customize and extend  
- uses Baileys as the core library  
- lightweight and efficient  

if you're interested in modifying or improving this script, feel free to fork and try it out. i encourage contributions and collaboration to make this project even better.
