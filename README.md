## Description
This project is a WhatsApp bot created out of boredom and just for fun. It leverages the **Laurine** API to provide a set of features for the bot. The bot uses various technologies, including REST API and Baileys, to support custom pairing with `whiskeysockets` for WhatsApp interactions.

## REST API
