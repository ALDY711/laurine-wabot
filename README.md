## My script for the umpteenth time ðŸ—¿
yayaya this script has nothing good in it, but this time I will try to update this script, and share it for free for you mwehehehe. so, don't sell it, okay, friends.

## Thank you to those who have helped me

â€“ [`@kiuur`](https://github.com/kiuur) that's me, and [`@kangfarrel`](https://github.com/kangfarrel) baileys

## some little information 
This script actually supports buttons, but I suggest not to use buttons on WhatsApp yet, and I use Baileys from [`@kangfarrel`](https://github.com/kangfarrel/felzar-Baileys). okay, good luck trying this script
